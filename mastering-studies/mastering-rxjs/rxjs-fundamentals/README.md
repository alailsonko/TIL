# [RxJS Fundamentals](https://frontendmasters.com/courses/rx-js/)

This respository contains the exercises and sample applications used in [Steve's](https://twitter.com/stevekinney) RxJS Fundamentals course for [Frontend Masters](https://frontendmasters.com).

All of the lessons can be found at https://rxjs-fundamentals.netlify.app.

## Getting Started

You can get _everything_ started by running `npm start` and heading over to `http://localhost:1234`. If for some reason the combined command is giving you trouble, then you can run each of the following separate terminal windows for the same effect.

There are four major components to this repository.

- Sample applications: `npm run ui`.
- API: `npm run api`.
- Lessons: `npm run lessons` (Although, you probably just want to visit [the website](https://rxjs-fundamentals.netlify.app) for that.)
- Tests: `npm test`.

Alternatively, you can spin up both the sample applications and the server at the same time using `npm run both`.
